# Grim Dawn CLI (Command Line Interface)
`gd-cli` is a simple[1] tool I wrote for searching Grim Dawn alts for items.

[1] Decrypting the player's save files and cross-referencing the data with the database & localization files was anything but simple.

# Credits
I used several other Grim Dawn tools as examples for the stash/character/database logic.
- marius00 for [https://github.com/marius00/iagd/](Grim Dawn Item Assistant).
- Aaron Hutchinson for [https://github.com/AaronHutchinson/Grim-Dawn-Save-Decryption/](Grim Dawn Save Decryption). The code samples were especially concise and readable.
- Chris Elison for [https://github.com/ChrisElison/GDParser/](GDParser).
